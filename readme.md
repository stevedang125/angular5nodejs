# Daily fun tasks:

This project is a personal daily task manager created for fun. 
It supports:
1) Encrypted login/register for each user(bcrypt hash and salt password).
   After logged in, generate a token and save it to the local storage.
2) Task lookup(angular pipe filter).
3) Task edition, deletion and insertion by sending http put, delete, post request in authservice.
4) Auto update the task list(fast response).

This project utilizes the MEAN stack: MongoDB(mLab), Express, Angular5, and NodeJS
